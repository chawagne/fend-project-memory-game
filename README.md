## Instructions

This project is part of my Udacity coursework and aims to highlight my proficiency in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.  

You can play the game by downloading and opening `index.html` or see it live at https://chawagne.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/.

### Rules

Select a card to flip it over.  You will see a symbol.  Select another card.  If the symbols match, they will remain flipped.  If they do not match, try to memorize them.  Clicking will flip them back over.  Your goal is to match all cards.
